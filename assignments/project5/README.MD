# Project 5 - Environment Mapping and Reflections

Implement environment mapping for background and reflective surfaces in WebGL.

## Requirements

- Cube-map reflections + Blinn shading on `.obj` models  
- Render background cube with cube-map (no depth write)  
- Rotate environment with camera  
- Reflective sphere using cube-map  
- Reflections use view direction and surface normal
