# Project 6 - Shadow Mapping 

In this project we will implement shadow mapping.

## Requirements

- Load the `.obj` file as the first input.
- Render the object and a plane beneath it.
- Implement shadows from a spotlight onto both the object and the plane.
- The object should cast shadows onto itself; the plane does not cast shadows.
- Use a depth map (e.g., via a framebuffer) to generate shadow information.
