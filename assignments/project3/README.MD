# Project 3 - Textures (WebGL)

## Overview

In this project, we will apply texture mapping to add color variation to 3D models using WebGL. You will load texture data from material files (`.mtl`) and bind them to 3D objects parsed from `.obj` files.

---

## Requirements

- Obtain the diffuse texture image filename from the `.mtl` file associated with the `.obj` file.
- Generate a vertex buffer for texture coordinates.
- The diffuse texture should be correctly displayed on the object.

## Additional Requirements (Optional)

- Include the specular texture specified in the `.mtl` file to adjust the specular color of the object.
